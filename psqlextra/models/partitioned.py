        This is quite complex because Django allows a variety of options:

        1. No PK at all. In this case, Django generates one named `id`
           as an auto-increment integer (AutoField)

        2. One field that has `primary_key=True`. Any field can have
           this attribute, but Django would error if there were more.

           is of type `CompositePrimaryKey` that includes that
           field.

        is to find the field (if any) that is going to become
        the primary key of the table.

        1. If there is a `CompositePrimaryKey`, that field becomes the primary key.

        2. If there is a field with `primary_key=True`, that field becomes the primary key.
